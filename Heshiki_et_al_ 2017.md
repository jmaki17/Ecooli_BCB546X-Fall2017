#Introduction to Paper
###  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heshiki et al. 2017 wanted to assess to what degree Hong Kong bank notes serve as a media for transmitting pathogens and drug resistance. They characterized the bacterial community _in vitro_ and by metagenomic analysis that included data on microbial diversity, profiling of potential pathogens and antibiotic-resistance markers on banknotes collected from both hospitals and metro station cashiers. They used metagenomic shotgun sequences
